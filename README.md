I created this interactive dashboard for a supermarket shop, where I analyzed sales with insights on:
 📊 Total Sales, Profit & Profit %
 📅 Monthly & Daily Sales Trends
 🏆 Top Products and Categories
 🛒 Category-wise Contribution
 💳 Payment Modes & Sales Types
✨ Features I included:
 ✔ Dynamic slicers (Year, Month, Payment Mode, Sales Type)
 ✔ A scrolling bar chart to view 10 products at a time
 ✔ Interactive visuals for decision-making
 ✔ KPIs for quick performance tracking
